# LibMaster
LibMaster is a tool that enables repeatedly using similar function blocks in different DPU configration files. It takes **DPU libraries** and a **DPU database**, and then generates a new DPU file following an **Application plan**. Before using this tool, users should have DPU libraries with **correct standards**, which will be specified in this README.
